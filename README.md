# Control RGB LED displays from Rust

This repository contains rust bindings for the C++ library
[rpi-rgb-led-matrix](https://github.com/hzeller/rpi-rgb-led-matrix),
which enables controlling Hub75 based displays. It includes both raw bindings
to the library in [`rpi-led-matrix-sys`] as well as higher level, safe rust
bindings in [`rpi-led-matrix`].
